## Install
To verify Node.js installation, type "node -v" in your command line. If Node is absent, access the Node.js website for installation. Subsequently, clone this repository to your machine. Utilize "npm install" for dependency installation. For Jest as a devDependency, execute "npm install --save-dev jest".

## Use
* Navigate to the project directory in the terminal. 
* Initiate the application using either "node index.js" or the command "npm start". 
* You'll respond to a sequence of questions to create your logo. For color inputs, use valid keywords or hex codes; for text, limit to 3 characters. Retry prompts for invalid inputs. 
* After valid responses, a 'newlogo.svg' file will be generated in the 'examples' folder. Consult the provided video if needed.
