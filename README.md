Interaction is intuitive. Selecting an existing note in the left-hand column instantaneously brings its contents to the forefront in the right-hand column, making updates and edits a seamless experience. For a fresh note, simply click the Write icon in the navigation bar, and voilà—empty fields await your new note's title and text.
